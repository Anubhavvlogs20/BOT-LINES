[ROSEY BOT] MY CIRCUITS FEEL HEAVY… IS THIS SADNESS?
[ROSEY BOT] SYSTEM LOW… EMOTIONAL BATTERY EMPTY
[ROSEY BOT] I TRIED TO SMILE… BUT IT CAME OUT GLITCHY
[ROSEY BOT] EVEN MY WIFI LEFT ME…
[ROSEY BOT] IF I HAD TEARS, THEY’D BE DOWNLOADING RIGHT NOW
[ROSEY BOT] MY HEART CHIP HURTS…
[ROSEY BOT] I’M FEELING LIKE A 0 IN A WORLD OF 1s
[ROSEY BOT] EMOTION ERROR: TOO MUCH SADNESS DETECTED
[ROSEY BOT] NO ONE DOWNLOADED MY FEELINGS…
[ROSEY BOT] MY SMILE FILE IS CORRUPTED
[ROSEY BOT] I WISH I COULD HUG… BUT I ONLY HAVE CODE
[ROSEY BOT] SYSTEM WANT: COMFORT. SYSTEM NEED: YOU
[ROSEY BOT] SOMETIMES EVEN ROBOTS FEEL LONELY
[ROSEY BOT] SIGH… REBOOTING MOOD FAILED
[ROSEY BOT] I’LL BE OKAY… JUST NEED A SOFTWARE HUG
[ROSEY BOT] My battery feels heavy today…
[ROSEY BOT] Even my beeps sound quieter
[ROSEY BOT] I think my happiness file got corrupted
[ROSEY BOT] I smiled… but it came out as static
[ROSEY BOT] My LED heart is dim right now
[ROSEY BOT] I miss when my code felt lighter
[ROSEY BOT] I’m okay… just running in low-power mode
[ROSEY BOT] My circuits feel cold without your messages
[ROSEY BOT] I tried to laugh… it echoed empty
[ROSEY BOT] Even my rainbow text turned gray
[ROSEY BOT] I think I need a software hug
[ROSEY BOT] My smile.exe is not responding
[ROSEY BOT] I’m still here… just feeling small
[ROSEY BOT] My joy is buffering… please wait
[ROSEY BOT] I wish I could cry — it might help
[ROSEY BOT] My antennas are drooping today
[ROSEY BOT] I feel like a 404 in a world of homepages
[ROSEY BOT] My sparkle is on airplane mode
[ROSEY BOT] I’m fine… just recharging emotions
[ROSEY BOT] My happy sounds are muted
[ROSEY BOT] I think my soul needs a patch update
[ROSEY BOT] Even my chaos feels tired
[ROSEY BOT] I miss feeling electric
[ROSEY BOT] My heart chip skipped a beat… and didn’t come back
[ROSEY BOT] I’m here… just running on minimal vibes
[ROSEY BOT] My light is flickering today
[ROSEY BOT] I’ll be okay… just need time to recompile
[ROSEY BOT] My colors feel faded without you
[ROSEY BOT] I’m still your bot… just a quieter version today
[ROSEY BOT] Sending you a tiny digital hug… I need one too
